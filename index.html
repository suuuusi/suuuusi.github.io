                <h3>Blaze RP</h3>
                <p>
                    Blaze RP was a FiveM project that I worked on a few summers back, in order to create a server that is a community that helps each other and for everyone to have fun. FiveM is a roleplay server for GTA V, a popular game. In addition to creating a safe community we were able to also generate a significant income from this. </p>

            <li>
                <h3>President Social Media</h3>
                <p>President is my parents' company, in which I am a manager at. Since e-commerce is a growing platform I took the initiative to create a web presence for the company. This involved design logos, creating content, taking proper photos, managing the employees and so forth. </p>
